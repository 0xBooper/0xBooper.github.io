      <p>(Note: The USB drive can be found at  <span><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/EMTEC-ECMMD64GB253-Flash-Drive-Slide/dp/B01N24H1NU">https://www.amazon.ca/EMTEC-ECMMD64GB253-Flash-Drive-Slide/dp/B01N24H1NU</a></span>.)</p>
      <p>This drive was given to me as a birthday gift, by the way.</p>
      <p>This "Usb 3.0" drive is WAY slower than normal 3.0 speeds. At best it could be a USB 2.0 drive, but definitely not a USB 3.0 drive.</p>
      <p>Speeds: </p>
      <p>The highest I got was 32mb per second, on a USB 2.0 port. On a USB 3.0 port, it sits around the same.</p>
      <p>Sometimes it can get REALLY slow, like 32kkb per second.</p>
      <p>Overall, I can't recommend this. If you're on a budget, and you don't care about the speed (and have some time to spare), I suppose this may be good.</p>
