        <p>I got this drive as a birthday gift, and here are my thoughts about it.</p>

        <p>Soo, this "Usb 3.0" drive is WAY slower than normal 3.0 speeds. At best it could be a USB 2.0 drive, but definitely not a USB 3.0 drive. </p>

        <p>Speeds: (this wsas measured by transferring a 1gb file to and from the internal hard disk.)</p>
        <p>The highest speed I got was 32mb per second, on a usb 2.0 port, NOT 3.0. (This was when I transferred the said 1gb file to the internal drive.</p>
        <p>And it got so slow, that it got down to around 32KB per second.</p>

        <p>If you don't care about speed at all, and your pretty patient, I guess this could be a good drive. Otherwise, spend your money on something else that's way better.</p>
