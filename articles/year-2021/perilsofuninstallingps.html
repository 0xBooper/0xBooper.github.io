        <h2>Perils of Getting Rid of Photoshop</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>One day, I've been wanting to get rid of unneeded programs. Using the old Control Panel to uninstall stuff, I wanted to get rid of Adobe Creative Cloud and Photoshop, which I had absolutely no use for, and it was taking up gigabytes of space on
            my laptop. I first tried to uninstall Creative Cloud, which didn't work due to it saying that it's "needed for some programs". I tried to uninstall Photoshop, bringing me to now.</p>

        <p>Once I tried to uninstall Photoshop, it annoyingly didn't uninstall it and it instead open Creative Cloud. It forced me to create an account and so I did. Then it asked to update Creative Cloud, which at that time I gave up.</p>

        <p>I didn't update Creative Cloud as I didn't want to waste more space anyways.</p>

        <p>I mean, when proprietary software doesn't like you installing it, it'll probably make you have to install more just to uninstall a part of it.</p>
